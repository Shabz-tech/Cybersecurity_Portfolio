# Hey there — Welcome to My Networking and Cybersecurity Portfolio

Thanks for stopping by!

This repository is my personal, hands-on journey into the world of Networking and Cybersecurity — and it’s built to give you an idea of tools I am familiar with. The labs will also showcase my ability to learn and pick new things up very quickly as well.

If we haven’t met yet:  
I love taking complex concepts and translating them into something approachable, practical, and beginner-friendly. I started these labs as my own structured study plan from a full beginner and work towards my goal as a SOC Analyst. I decided that I should also document my learning journey for anyone who wants to learn cybersecurity in a realistic, hands-on way.
